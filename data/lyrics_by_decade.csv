May you keep robbing me of the cool songs
You keep smiling at me.
I see you singing songs Rahu
If you promise to accompany
May you keep robbing me of the cool songs

How many waterways are scattered in Fizao but
I didn't call anyone until Abb.
When you saw you, your eyes said this.
We don't have to get out of our faces.
If you stay ahead of my eyes
I steal my eyes from every shay.
If you promise to accompany
May you keep robbing me of the cool songs

I carved the barso in Khwabo which
You're the same photo of Sange Murmer
Don't you understand that you're being punched.
May I think you are my destiny.
If you understand me as yours
Rahu decorating the mahfil of the deaf in
If you promise to accompany
May you keep robbing me of the cool songs

I walked alone for too long.
Now the journey is not the end of life.
When the sole is not a colorful support
Time is not the end of infidel youth.
If you keep going in our footsteps
I lay stars on the floor Rahu
If you promise to accompany
May you keep robbing me of the cool songs
You keep smiling at me.
I see you sing the song Rahu.

My destination is you
Why am I from the storm?
Alcohol is my sahil you
Tell someone to storm

Your eyes understood
Worthy of love to me
The heartbeat of the heart stops
I got the floor
Your eyes understood. Gestures take heart in gestures
Tell me where you learned this skill from.
To do magic in the eyes
I have learned my life from where you

You have touched my heart
What was in this?
who has knocked me down
That was the cruel act.
That was the cruel act.
Yeh Ranjha Ki Baate Yeh Majnu Ke Tales
It's no different from my story.
Gestures take heart in gestures
Tell me where you learned this skill from.

The love that they do
They don't show love.
Beat your heart
Never tell anyone.
Don't tell anyone
What was the fun when
be done by yourself
Express love with your tongue
To do magic in the eyes
I have learned my life from where you

This is the way to go and where
You are one in millions.
Even the eyes of Humari
Something, but give it to the shingles.
Something, but give it to the shingles.
The flower on which the naz was also on the springs
That's the flower we chose from Gulsita.
Gestures take heart in gestures
Tell me where you learned this skill from.
To do magic in the eyes
I have learned my life from where you
Tell me where you learned this skill from.
I have learned my life from where you
Tell me where you learned this skill from.
My life is taught by you from where you have."

No dream lamps
Light the lamp lit
Somewhere far away when the day falls
The Bride's Body
The stolen came secretly

Ever when
Heavy breaths
Sat all over
When the eyes are
ever-in-a-vis
walk with love
Someone touches me
did not look at
Somewhere far away when the day falls
The Bride's Body
The stolen came secretly

Somewhere in this heart.
Can never be found
get out somewhere
as the previous births.
There was confusion
Barry's own mind
be your own
endured pain
When somewhere far away
The day passes
the bride of the bull
Stolen the body
Came secretly.

My heart is tempted by me.
Someone should come

There is no such partner
There is such a lover.
Thirst goes to the arm of the heart

On the blue blue amber
When the moon came
Shower love, humko crave

O cham chamm karta sawan
Run arrows of the drops
In the rainy season when

O cham chamm karta sawan
Run arrows of the drops
In the rainy season when

On the blue blue amber
When the moon came
Shower love, humko crave
 When you saw it, i thought of it.

Sometimes Aditi feels like a dream if she gets separated
So how can one stop their tears from flowing?
Everything's Gonna Be Okay

Sometimes there was neither happiness nor fun in life
Sometimes it's hard every day and every moment a punishment
In such a situation, how can someone smile, how to laugh and be happy
Everything's Gonna Be Okay

Think just know how much we want you
We also cry if tears come in your eyes
The song doesn't come but still we sing
O Aditi, sometimes there is darkness in all
But only after the night is the morning

Sometimes Aditi seems to be one's own in life
Sometimes Aditi feels like a dream if she gets separated
Hey Aditi Hans De Hans De Hans De Hans De Hans De Tu Zara
Otherwise, just smile a little little bit little bit

If you are happy then it seems that where is happiness
Sun rises from the clouds and share life
When you hear a little drunken wind started telling you
That Aditi, those who parted would get back one day or the other.
Whether you know this Aditi or not, the flowers bloom again To say jashn-e-deaf is deaf
Ishq is surprised to see this
To say jashn-e-deaf is deaf
Ishq is surprised to see this
The scent from the flower is khafa khafa in Gulson
There is no pip hidden in the chillman of Fiza

We have a view from Surrey
Sleeping is the edge of time.
And there are no lost things in the heart.

How does anyone say it's ours or not?
Traveling with you
There are still gaps, but
Like there are no two sides of a valley.
They are near, but they are not near.
We don't want to have this gum
There is a wall of glass like a door.

We have a view from Surrey
Sleeping is the edge of time.
And there are no lost things in the heart.

We don't even meet together.
There is no blooming either.
In the eyes there is a bloom in the heart.

It won't go down until the morning.
This is the intoxication of this moment.
What to do with it
This is tomorrow's promise.

One for your sake.
This jam is spilled

My go, my go, my go.
My go, my go, my go.

(music)

less deeply than my eyes.
Be of intoxication scales

less deeply than my eyes.
of drug scales
You want to drown in them.
The hearts of the guests

Broken for your sake
These are the khab diwans
Hi

My go, my go, my go.
My go, my go, my go.

The night that has come to intoxicating
Every single thing of it is intoxicating.
You also come and drink.

The two met with drugs
This rain of intoxication is intoxicating
You also come and drink.

My go, my go, my go.
My go, my go, my go. Hare-, Hare Ram...
Hare Ram, Hare Ram, Hare Krishna, Hare Ram
Hare Ram, Hare Ram
Hare Krishna, Hare Ram (let go, let go)

Kill on her hobby
Madly searchin' for this fine shawty
In my world, the number one hottie
Everywhere she make him go crazy

Your eyes are a mistake, things are a mistake.
Your eyes are a mistake, things are a mistake.

You keep drivin' me so crazy

Yes, heart, baby, heart, let this be yours.
But don't lose time in the but
Yes, let it be without thinking, but do a little bit on me.
I've been hit, ever since I've seen you
You are my silence, you are my friend.
You are my afsana
Makin' me so happy, shakin' my body
You are the stray beat, you are the torment of the nights.
You are my heart.
Everything about you, baby, I like it
Beneath your sins is the paradise of my dreams.
Get relief from the restlessness by coming into your arms
My only wish is if I ever, ever could make you mine
Everyone, pray with me now, all day, all night long

Watchin' you
Where she at? I'm searchin' for this fine shawty
And it ain't like I'd be gettin' naughty

Cause I mean it when you hear me say that
Madly searchin' for this fine shawty
In my world, the number one hottie
Everywhere she make him go crazy
Got's to get me, yes, not a maybe"
