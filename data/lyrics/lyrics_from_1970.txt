They're for my sake.

Sometimes my heart
I think about it
like it rings
In the streets of the clarinets

The night is a veil
I'm picking up
The night is a veil
I'm picking up
You're falling short of Sharma

You want to live all your life.
It will rise towards me.
The eyes of love
I know that
You are non-existent, but you
I know that you
It's non-people, but you

Sometimes my heart
I think about it
Sometimes my heart
In the thought comes. Somewhere far away when the day falls
Sanjh's bride stolen the body
Came secretly to me.
in the courtyard of the thoughts
No dream lamps
Light the lamp lit
Somewhere far away when the day falls
The Bride's Body
The stolen came secretly

Ever when
Heavy breaths
Sat all over
When the eyes are
ever-in-a-vis
walk with love
Someone touches me
did not look at
Somewhere far away when the day falls
The Bride's Body
The stolen came secretly

Somewhere in this heart.
Can never be found
get out somewhere
as the previous births.
There was confusion
Barry's own mind
be your own
endured pain
When somewhere far away
The day passes
the bride of the bull
Stolen the body
Came secretly.
