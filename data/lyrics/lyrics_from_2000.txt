Sometimes Aditi feels like a dream if she gets separated
So how can one stop their tears from flowing?
Everything's Gonna Be Okay

Sometimes there was neither happiness nor fun in life
Sometimes it's hard every day and every moment a punishment
In such a situation, how can someone smile, how to laugh and be happy
Everything's Gonna Be Okay

Think just know how much we want you
We also cry if tears come in your eyes
The song doesn't come but still we sing
O Aditi, sometimes there is darkness in all
But only after the night is the morning

Sometimes Aditi seems to be one's own in life
Sometimes Aditi feels like a dream if she gets separated
Hey Aditi Hans De Hans De Hans De Hans De Hans De Tu Zara
Otherwise, just smile a little little bit little bit

If you are happy then it seems that where is happiness
Sun rises from the clouds and share life
When you hear a little drunken wind started telling you
That Aditi, those who parted would get back one day or the other.
Whether you know this Aditi or not, the flowers bloom again To say jashn-e-deaf is deaf

Sleeping is the edge of time.
And there are no lost things in the heart.

How to say what is sitam
Abbe thinks this is us
How does anyone say it's ours or not?
Traveling with you
There are still gaps, but
Like there are no two sides of a valley.
They are near, but they are not near.
We don't want to have this gum
There is a wall of glass like a door.

We have a view from Surrey
Sleeping is the edge of time.
And there are no lost things in the heart.

The heart chose him.
How did time tell us this story?
We who are arrogant if
He's not even happy to borrow.
As in meetings, it's like a tinge
We don't even meet together.
There is no blooming either.
In the eyes there is a bloom in the heart.
