When you walk the way, you turn the way
When the fireflies fly open the fist
When Nain Breaks These Rules All
and forget all the shells openly
Forget all, forget all.

So stuck
This mind is stuck
Something has gone wrong
This mind is stuck

So stuck

You are once a lake and
There's never a boat of memories.
You are the edge of my heart.

Sometimes you are a smoke and
There is never the shadows of the stars
All is my support.

When the rest of the world is foggy
When the night is still bright
When the heart prays
Boom with every beat
Boom, boom

So stuck
This mind is stuck
Something has gone wrong
This mind is stuck

So stuck
This mind is stuck
Something has gone wrong
This mind is stuck. Ankhiya Yeh Ankhiya Found Ankhiya

Do you know what Isha means?
A title of Durga as daughter of Himavat.
Now Parvati will not give along with Shiva, then who will give it?

Even in the autumn season

You are in the silence of the storm
Like Veena's Taro...

People say poor
Why do you lose?
When love is not found, then the heart
Made a name by cutting it

This swinging stray
How to win

But there is nothing ahead of you.
All the khakhs are equal
I will get lost.
Talk to me
