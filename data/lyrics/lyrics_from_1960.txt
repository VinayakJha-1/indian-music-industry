When the sole is not a colorful support
Time is not the end of infidel youth.
If you keep going in our footsteps
I lay stars on the floor Rahu
If you promise to accompany
May you keep robbing me of the cool songs
You keep smiling at me.
I see you sing the song Rahu.

Tell me where you learned this skill from.
To do magic in the eyes
I have learned my life from where you

You have touched my heart
What was in this?
who has knocked me down
That was the cruel act.
That was the cruel act.
Yeh Ranjha Ki Baate Yeh Majnu Ke Tales
It's no different from my story.

The love that they do
They don't show love.

You are one in millions.
Even the eyes of Humari
Something, but give it to the shingles.
Something, but give it to the shingles.
The flower on which the naz was also on the springs
That's the flower we chose from Gulsita.

Tell me where you learned this skill from.
My life is taught by you from where you have.
